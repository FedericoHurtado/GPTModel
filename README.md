# GPTModel
GPT model developed as a final project for Intro to AI class. 

## Prerequisites:
- pip install tiktoken
- install pytorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ 

## Project Description
This is a basic Generative Pretrained Transformer model that I created for my Intro To AI final project at Virginia Tech. I completed this project individually, and made use of many
online resources in order to learn how to get my first experience with building a real neural network from scratch. I hope to build off these skills in future work.

## Usage
1. Install all prerequistes
2. Run ./driver.py
3. Wait for the model to be created, and .txt files will be created in a directory called TrainingResults where the model output every 500 training iterations will print out. NOTE: This may take a long time depending on hardware. For reference, it takes roughly 30 minutes to run on my Windows XPS laptop.
